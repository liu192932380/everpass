# EverPass – A Zero-Trust, Condition-Triggered Vault for Digital Legacy & Life Messages

**EverPass** is a decentralized, zero-trust vault system that allows users to encrypt and deliver sensitive content—wallet keys, inheritance instructions, files, or personal messages—to trusted recipients **only when specific conditions are met**, such as prolonged inactivity, death confirmation, or a scheduled time.

> From crypto seed phrases to final words, EverPass delivers what matters—securely, privately, and only when the time is right.

## ✅ Use Cases

- **Crypto inheritance**: transfer wallet access or keys only after death or loss  
- **Personal legacy**: deliver messages, instructions, or memories to loved ones  
- **Estate planning**: distribute financial and legal info over time  
- **Emergency handoffs**: release critical data if you disappear  
- **Multi-phase delivery**: spread content over weeks, months, or years

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

- **Zero-trust design** – platform cannot see or decrypt any content  
- **Client-side encryption** – AES-256 encrypted locally before storage  
- **Trigger-based delivery** – conditions like inactivity, deadlines, or confirmations  
- **Open source** – trust through transparency

## ⚙️ MVP Feature Set

- In-browser encryption (AES-256-GCM)  
- Trigger logic (X days inactive, third-party witness, date-based)  
- Multi-recipient, multi-stage content vaults  
- File support (documents, images, text, audio)  
- Optional IPFS or decentralized storage  
- Planned: Shamir Secret Sharing, encrypted deadman DAO modules

## 💡 Why EverPass?

Billions in digital assets are lost every year due to keyholders passing unexpectedly.  
But beyond crypto, many people leave behind no plan, no goodbye, no instructions.

**EverPass helps you prepare. To be heard. To be trusted. To be remembered.**
