# EverPass – A Zero-Trust Vault for Timed, Trusted Information Delivery

**EverPass** is a zero-trust, decentralized tool designed to securely store and deliver encrypted messages, files, instructions, or personal data to trusted recipients—only when specific conditions are met, such as prolonged silence, predefined dates, or multi-party confirmations.

> From heartfelt letters to critical keys, EverPass ensures your most important messages are delivered—only when they truly matter.

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- **Life transition messages**: Advice or final words to family or partners
- **Crypto inheritance**: Secure transfer of keys or wallet instructions
- **Timed confessions**: Truths to be revealed only after delay or silence
- **Multi-phase disclosures**: Gradual delivery of sensitive information
- **Emergency backups**: Legal or health instructions if you go silent

> While EverPass can deliver inheritance-related content, it is **not a legally binding will**. Legal recognition may emerge in the future, depending on jurisdictions.
